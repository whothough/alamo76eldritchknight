			<p>A cloaked figure steps out from the burning inn onto the muddy street, screams echo around him as he tries to clear his head from the explosion. The laughter of nearby bandits sbrings the man's vision back into focus. THe man flexes his hand as ice crystalizes down his blade. They chose the wrong inn.</p>
			<p class="indent">A young half-elf curses under her breath</p>
			<p class="indent">The dwarf general slams their fist against the table</p>
			<p class="indent">Eldritch champions are a collective group of warrior scholars</p>
			<h4>TOGETHER AND ALONE</h4>
			<p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p>
			<h4>CREATING AN ELDRITCH CHAMPION</h4>
			<p>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character’s background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p>
			<p class="indent">You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death’s embrace.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution. Second, choose the soldier background.</p>
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
			<p>As a fighter, you gain the following class features.</p>

			<description>Roll a d6. Until the end of your next turn, or the next time you change stances, you can use your reaction to add the result to a saving throw, add it to your AC, add it to the attack or damage roll of one of your attacks, or add it to an Acrobatics or Performance check. Once the d6 is spent, it is lost until you enter this stance again.</description>
